[{"content":"How to Convert a Music Sheet to a Mandolin Tab Hey there ! Learning the Mando, wanted to start easy with tabs, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any for the song I wanted, so I created it. And now that I know how to do it, you might learn how to do it as well.\nI decline all responsibility if you end up using tools for downloading content your don\u0026rsquo;t own. The purpose of this guide is to help you import and convert a music sheet that you currently have, even thought I discuss briefly how to get some.\nWell, so I got a Mandolin and decided that Maiden Voyage OST from Sea Of Thieves was a good starter. Found a reddit post with some tabs, but I found it lacked some notes. My opinion is worth nothing anyway, but I ended up on this score on MuseScore.\nBut hey, MuseScore is paid now for downloading scores, and it is using a Baryton, not a mando ! Well, no worries, I got everything worked out.\nFirst, download MuseScore without Muse Hub. Install it. Edit : You need to download version 3.2.3 in a .msi file on Windows. That is, if you need Android to work properly, as of 2023-09-07, only scores created on 3.2.3 are readable on Android. More informations here.\nThen, it isn\u0026rsquo;t the scope of this guide, but you will need to gather a music sheet of the song you want to learn. This can be found on the internet, on MuseScore or you might need to use libre-score. Either way, you end up with a midi or pdf file and you\u0026rsquo;ll use it on MuseScore app that you previously installed.\nEither import the PDF or open the midi file. This is done using the File menu, top left.\nThen, delete the instruments that you don\u0026rsquo;t need in the instrument tab on the left panel.\nAdd an instrument, a mandolin. You might need to search for it as it is not found under a category. You can also enter the instrument panel using i shortcut.\nNow click on the triangle on the left of the Mandolin, that\u0026rsquo;ll open the staves. Right click the default one and select Create Linked Stave. Then use the gear box of the newly created stave, and use Tab 4 str full.\nYou now should have a line with the music sheet you imported using the instrument it had, a music sheet for the mandolin and one for the mandolin tabs.\nHow to copy them to your mandolin stave ? You\u0026rsquo;ll click on the beginning of your former instrument stave, then use CTRL+SHIFT+END to select all the notes of that instrument, adn copy them using CTRL+V. Then you can paste it on your mandolin music sheet by clicking on the first case and using CTRL+V.\nIt will automatically convert to a mandolin tab. But the notes might not have the right key/pitch. If you still have all the mandolin notes selected, simply use the UP or DOWN key to adjust to the wanted key. Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what would be standard for a Mandolin, feel free to help me out and I\u0026rsquo;ll make a correction. I used my ear and found the good one.\nYou can finally save your sheet and use it on MuseScore. Tadaaa !\nSome other useful links :\nHow to Instantly Convert Sheet Music to Tab Notation for Free! with MuseScore 3 - YouTube Mandolin tab | MuseScore Convert standard notation to mandolin tab | MuseScore ","date":"2023-09-05T21:50:17+01:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/how-to-convert-a-music-sheet-to-a-mandolin-tab/","title":"How to Convert a Music Sheet to a Mandolin Tab"},{"content":"Obsidian Publish Alternative, How to One-click Upload Your Notes on Your Own Website This post is an extension of my main post showcase of my Obsidian workflow. You might want to check it out as well.\nCreate You Own Hugo Website Prerequisites I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that you installed Hugo following their quick-start documentation and Git on your computer, and that you know how to clone a repository from Github. If not, Google and Chat GPT are your friends here.\nCreate Your Website Repository on Github First thing you need to do is to create your website repository on Github.\nName it website_name.github.io with website_name being your desired website name. (Thanks captain obvious).\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to tick the Add a README file. It will prevent cloning an empty repository that will lead to issues if you\u0026rsquo;re not comfortable with Git.\nCreate Your Website on Local You\u0026rsquo;ll now head to a folder of your choice on your computer.\nI\u0026rsquo;m simply using my documents folder inside my home in Ubuntu. But you might use Documents in Windows or anything else.\nOpen a command prompt inside this folder. Using Windows Terminal you should be able to right click inside the Documents folder and select Open in terminal. Or use the cd command to navigate to the right folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Linux user, I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that you know what you are doing.\nInput the following command :\n1 hugo new site website_name Then to get inside the newly created website folder :\n1 cd website_name And you\u0026rsquo;ll now add your Hugo website template as a git submodule.\n1 git submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack There\u0026rsquo;s other ways of installing a theme, I just made a choice :\nUsing the theme quick-start → Usually end up being hard to configure Using a simple git clone instead of a submodule → It\u0026rsquo;ll be a pain to update the theme Using a Hugo module → Configuration involves creating folder, I\u0026rsquo;m a lazy ass, I\u0026rsquo;m configuring my theme directly from my theme folder. By the way, if you want to be able to modify the theme, you should fork the theme, and update the .gitmodules file with your forked repository link. If not, just keep it this way with the official hugo-theme-stack repository.\nAnyway, now you should find the hugo.toml file and delete it. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the theme configuration file.\nSpeaking of which, copy the whole exampleSite folder content at the root of your website_name folder.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll now have a config.yaml configured correctly, meaning with the good theme and all the base configs. You can also steal mine. I don\u0026rsquo;t really mind, if anything, it\u0026rsquo;ll make me happy to see websites created thanks to my guide.\nJust don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change at least the baseurl to https://website_name.github.io/ and your website title.\nPlease make sure to add the following two lines to your config.yaml as well :\n1 2 3 # Error handling configuration for internal markdown link not found refLinksErrorLevel: WARNING refLinksNotFoundURL: https://website_name.github.io/404 They will assure that your website still build even if you push a note that has a link to an un-uploaded note, and redirect to your 404 page if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t find the requested URL.\nIcons and avatar are saved inside the assets folder. Except for your website favicon that goes into the static folder.\nYou will now come back to your Documents folder and git clone your previously created repository. You now have a website_name folder containing your Hugo site folder with the theme as a git submodule. And a website_name.github.io folder containing a README.md file.\nYou just need to copy the website_name folder content inside your repository folder named website_name.github.io. And finally, commit and push !\nConfiguring the Github Pages Online Part First, you need to go to your website settings and configure how the site is build.\nThen create a .github folder.\nInside the folder, create a workflows folder.\nFinally, create a deploy.yml file. Add the following content :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 name: Deploy to Github Pages on: push: branches: [main] pull_request: branches: [main] jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: # Give the default GITHUB_TOKEN write permission to commit and push the # added or changed files to the repository. contents: write steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: \u0026#39;recursive\u0026#39; - name: Cache Hugo resources uses: actions/cache@v2 env: cache-name: cache-hugo-resources with: path: resources key: ${{ env.cache-name }} - uses: actions/setup-go@v2 with: go-version: \u0026#34;^1.17.0\u0026#34; - run: go version - name: Cache Go Modules uses: actions/cache@v2 with: path: | ~/.cache/go-build ~/go/pkg/mod key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles(\u0026#39;**/go.sum\u0026#39;) }} restore-keys: | ${{ runner.os }}-go- - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34; extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify --gc - name: Deploy 🚀 uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4 with: branch: gh-pages folder: public clean: true single-commit: true It is based on the hugo-stack-theme-starter repository, but configured to use a git submodule by adding the lines 20 and 21 :\n1 2 with: submodules: \u0026#39;recursive\u0026#39; If you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Github workflows, just keep in mind that this is the part that will automatically build your site from your main branch on Github and deploy the gh-pages branch that is the built website.\nConfigure Your Website I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t have the time nor the will to document every modification I made on my website. You have many options to learn how to do so :\nExplore my website repository and files Explore the hugo-theme-stack repository, its issues and discussions Explore the hugo-theme-stack documentations Basically, I changed and added some icons, added some left panel pages, and configured a comment section using giscus.\nUpload Content to Your Website You can simply change the share boolean to true in the note frontmatter, then select the command Upload filename to DEFAULT of the obsidian-github-publisher plugin from the note drop down menu. It will use some regex to convert wikilinks to standard Hugo links, commit and push to the relevant repository on Github, make a pull request that\u0026rsquo;ll be automatically accepted, and then use some Github Actions to build your website.\nAttachments are automatically sent as well as linked notes as long as they have the share boolean set to true as well.\nThe posts will be sent to the content/post folder and the attachments to the content/images folder.\n","date":"2023-08-02T18:55:32+01:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/obsidian-publish-alternative-how-to-one-click-upload-your-notes-on-your-own-website/","title":"Obsidian Publish Alternative, How to One-click Upload Your Notes on Your Own Website"},{"content":"Why Using Obsidian for Life Management This post is an extension of my main post showcase of my Obsidian workflow. You might want to check it out as well.\nWhat is GTD ? If you already know all of that, skip this section.\nGetting Things Done is a book written by David Allen. I recommend reading it, really. Like everything, reading key concepts online is good, but a whole book gives you a much better understanding of the underlying concepts described, why and how it works. I know it might sound like a lot of time, but it\u0026rsquo;s all worth it, trust me.\nBut if you still don\u0026rsquo;t have the time or the willingness to read GTD, try at least to read Todoist\u0026rsquo;s guide or my personal interpretation below.\nDefinitions A task is a clear action step, something to be done. It must be precise and concrete.\nA one-off task is a task that is enough by itself. Like \u0026ldquo;Calling the dentist to make an appointment\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Doing the dishes\u0026rdquo;.\nA project is a bunch of tasks to achieve a goal. It must have a due date, at least one that you tell yourself.\nKey Concepts GTD is all about capturing every thoughts you have, clarifying them, organizing them, and acting on them. Your brain should be a factory for new ideas, not a warehouse.\nSo you need an inbox, easily and quickly accessible everywhere to clear your head. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Todoist and the obsidian-todoist-plugin for that, but more on that latter. Every-time something (small or big) crosses your mind, you capture (step 1) it in here. It might be \u0026ldquo;clean the house\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;learn to play piano\u0026rdquo;, anything really.\nThen you need to clarify (step 2) these items you\u0026rsquo;ve captured. For instance :\nA task must be a clear and concrete action step (\u0026ldquo;laundry\u0026rdquo; ❌ → \u0026ldquo;Do the laundry at the laundrette\u0026rdquo; ✅). A project must be a goal to achieve (use the SMART goal setting). A reference material might be a note, a link, or a document to store that might help achieving some tasks. Or you might just need to store it for later unknown purpose. Be careful not to fall in the collector fallacy trying to store and remember everything as if Wikipedia didn\u0026rsquo;t yet exist. You then organise (step 3) them :\nA task might be delegated or waiting for something, it might be the next action of a project, it might have to wait for a start date, be scheduled for a particular day, have a due date, etc. A project must have a due date, we need time constraint because it helps us see how much we have to do and not put too much on our plate. If there\u0026rsquo;s no due date, it goes into the someday maybe list of things you\u0026rsquo;d do one day. A reference material must be filled accordingly. If it\u0026rsquo;s a piece of information you can create a note, if it\u0026rsquo;s a document you might use your cloud storage, if it\u0026rsquo;s a link you might save it using Omnivore. Tasks in obsidian-tasks vault have different properties, and are displayed by urgency using the default sorting. In short, you have to worry about these one using my template :\nHappens date : A due date : Date by which the task needs to be completed. A scheduled date : Date on which you plan to work on your task A start date : Date by which you can start working on a specific task. Possibly because you can\u0026rsquo;t do that task before this date. Context tag : A tag describing in which context you can do this task. This can be something like \u0026ldquo;phone\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;online\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;errands\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;mail\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;transports\u0026rdquo;, etc. Time available : Not used actively in this vault but might take the form of a tags as well. Energy available : Used in this vault but in the form of a tags just like contexts. Priority : Task property from obsidian-task plugin. You must review (step 4) your system periodically. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m using daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes. But more on that later as well, just remember that this is a really important part of the process and helps maintaining it.\nFinally, you need to engage (step 5) → It\u0026rsquo;s about time to get things done don\u0026rsquo;t you think ? That\u0026rsquo;s the fifth part.\nHorizons of Focus In GTD, there\u0026rsquo;s multiple horizons of focus :\nTasks : Actions to take Projects : A bigger task with two or more sub-tasks Areas of focus/responsibility : Areas of your life with a standard to maintain Goals \u0026amp; Objectives : Short term goals for this or next year (1-2 years) Visions : How and where do you see yourself in a few years (3-5 years) Purpose and principles : Who you are, what is your purpose and on what principles do you live I learned that having goals alongside projects didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me as I would put goals somewhere but never act on it. That\u0026rsquo;s why on this system inside obsidian, projects are goals, they live inside areas of my life.\nIf I have a goal to become an artist, I might have a daily recurring task inside that would be \u0026ldquo;Draw for 15min each day\u0026rdquo;. Or if I want to have a nice party next weekend as a goal, I might need to contact friends, prepare my shopping list, take friday off, etc.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t just put on simple goals on a list and hope that your actions will go toward them. It won\u0026rsquo;t. But if you create a goal inside one of your areas file, that links to a project note where you can put next actions and notes, you\u0026rsquo;ll move forward and clear that goal before the estimated due date !\nSo in our case with this Obsidian setup :\nTasks : They can be created simply by using markdown tasks formatting anywhere on your vault except the _Sources folder, the -Workout-Log folder, the 4-Archives folder, the 5-Templates folder and the Media Backlog note. The obsidian-tasks is configured to exclude these folders by design choice. Projects : They live inside the 1-Projects folder. One note by goals or objectives, and inside the note you can put the tasks alongside notes and embedded attachments, just like you would with a piece of paper. Areas : Areas contains projects. That\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;re creating your projects in the form of obsidian tasks. You can use wikilinks to create the project note while doing so. You can also have some recurring tasks to maintain the area standard. And finally there\u0026rsquo;s an archive to clear the clutter using obsidian-tasks-archiver plugin. Visions, purpose and principles : They are less actionable and don\u0026rsquo;t require constant consideration. Just update the note every once in a while when you feel like your long term goals have changed after a big event in your life. Don\u0026rsquo;t change them often, focus on achieving tasks to progress in your goals instead. How to Use This Vault Template for Life Management Inbox Alright, so if we want to have a GTD setup, first we need an Inbox. And those of you who already had an obsidian vault with some plugins might have spotted an important issue : Obsidian is slow to launch.\nWell, fortunately there\u0026rsquo;s a Todoist plugin for obsidian that gather tasks from your Todoist account. You can now quickly jot notes and tasks on your phone and computer directly inside Todoist\u0026rsquo;s inbox using shortcuts and see them inside the 0-Inbox file inside the 0-Inbox folder, or inside your daily-notes !\nWhy Using a Daily and Periodic Notes Instead of a Beautiful and Perfect Dashboard ? I used Notion, Notion users love clean dashboard. Obsidian folks love them too. Why I hate them ? I\u0026rsquo;m a perfectionist with many OCD1 issues. If I\u0026rsquo;m using a Dashboard, I\u0026rsquo;ll need to update it every time I feel like it (often), and end up spending more time fine tuning a board and maintaining it than acting on my life.\nUsing Daily and Periodic Notes allows you to use template, modify these templates if needed but without needing backward modifications everywhere.\nEmbrace the fact that you can change along your life journey.\nIt also provides an easy way to zoom in or zoom out to get the big picture. For instance, during a stressed period one might only rely on the daily notes and the current most important project. And as things calm down, you might consider seeing weekly, then monthly, eventually quarterly and finally yearly notes for projects plans and move their due date before to work on them.\nI spoke about reviewing your system periodically before. I used to have some \u0026ldquo;periodic\u0026rdquo; checklist to do every periods. I ended that as it became a habit to sort pictures daily, budget weekly, clean files monthly, backup quarterly and yearly. But you might also use these notes template with tasks to do at the beginning or end of each period. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t, having periodic notes \u0026ldquo;forces\u0026rdquo; you to review where you are by zooming in and out of your day to day activities.\nYou also get a cool archive of tasks and projects achieved, and that\u0026rsquo;s great !\nThe Daily Note The daily note is the note you\u0026rsquo;ll open each morning when you wake up and each evening when you finish your working day.\nThe first part looks like this :\nThe name of the note is the current date in the ISO 8601 format. You also get the weekday, and some navigation to the periodic notes where the day belongs to and to the previous and next day.\nYou also have some shortcut to you Dashboard 🗺️ and Taskboard ✅ files, they helps you not to miss a project or a task respectively inside your vault. More on that later.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s some introductions callouts :\nOngoing medias from your Media Backlog → Dataview script that show the medias inside columns containing the word Doing. Time left in each periods → Using a dataviewjs function based on the one provided to me by Dovos from the Dataview discord following an obsidian post. Google calendar weekly view → Using obsidian-google-calendar plugin to show a weekly view of your google calendar. Tasks Calendar using obsidian-tasks-calendar plugin based on obsidian-tasks and obsidian-dataview plugins. Ongoing and upcoming projects from your areas files inside 2-Areas folder. There\u0026rsquo;s also a notes space where you can create some one-off tasks while clarifying the Todoist inbox that sits just below.\nThe second part is all about tasks :\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just a simple set of callout containing tasks queries :\nOverdue tasks Tasks due today Upcoming tasks in the next 30 days Next actions grouped by context tags Waiting for tasks Delegated tasks You finally get to the journaling part :\nThis part contains :\nA task log for tasks done today Your workout log scanning for daily workouts Your recurring tasks And finally : Your journal ! Evaluate your mood (1-5), give a title to your day, write down your thoughts, be grateful, and write down the good things you brought to this world.\nThe Periodic Notes Basically a periodic note look like this :\nYou will get for each periodic view some slightly different templates :\nThe time left callout A google calendar weekly view if on a weekly note, or schedule view if on a monthly note A task calendar with a weekly or monthly view depending on the note type Your projects happening during this time period The projects you achieved during this time period A task log (only if on a weekly note) A journal entry How Not to Miss a Task or Project Inside My Vault ? The TaskBoard ✅ and Dashboard 🗺️ files will find any unplanned task or project inside your vault, as long as they are not inside any of the excluded files and folders :\n1 2 3 4 5 path does not include Archives path does not include Templates path does not include Workout_Log path does not include Media Backlog path does not include _Sources The Someday Maybe Note The Someday Maybe 💭 file is where you put your future goals and objectives in the form of a simple bullet list. Nothing fancy, we don\u0026rsquo;t care it\u0026rsquo;s not important as of now. But you might want to put things you want to do here, wait for a bit and decide if they\u0026rsquo;re still relevant after a while. If yes, simply create a project and start working on it !\nHow to Use Other Functionalities Such as Journaling, Workout-logging, Media-tracking ? I\u0026rsquo;ll refer you to the main post that showcase my workflow.

Fast and simple one click upload obsidian publish alternative. But there\u0026rsquo;s plenty more. It took me some time here and there during the past year to come up with this setup. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry, it is easy to use despite its awfully long name. But I\u0026rsquo;ll describe it with as much depth as I can for people who wants to fine tune it.\nObviously, it is merely just a starting point, with Obsidian you can (and you always should) do something that works well for you. And that means creating your own setup. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t forbid you from using this one as a starting-point.\nWhy is it the Perfect Obsidian Setup (at Least for me) ? It embraces many relevant and high level productivity concepts alongside Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s powerful note linking feature while still being usable as a simple \u0026ldquo;I create a simple daily checklist with a few notes\u0026rdquo; in case of existential crisis. → That means the system will last.\nOf course using Obsidian also mean offline access and data possession. You can sync your data yourself using obsidian-git plugin.

Repository Alright, I\u0026rsquo;m in, how can I start ?\n→ Here you can find a Github repository with an example vault using my setup. All the plugins are configured to match with one another.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to login to the following plugins using your account :\nobsidian-todoist-plugin with your todoist axcount obsidian-google-calendar plugin with your Google account obsidian-omnivore plugin with your Omnivore account obsidian-github-publisher plugin with your GitHub account For the note-sharing part, you might want to take a look at my guide, along with my own website repository and how is it configured. It is based on hugo-theme-stack.\nI will briefly explain each functionality here as well, and with more details in other posts.\nWait ! Don\u0026rsquo;t Go Further ! I forgot something in the initial post. Here\u0026rsquo;s an update. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of quality of live improvements in this vault, here\u0026rsquo;s a few examples :\nIf you hit ctrl+S or just save the file, Obsidian will lint the file ! Meaning the whole writing, the frontmatter, the titles, the spacings, even the characters used for bold or italics will be standardized. In a way that works with my other plugins ! If you paste a link, the link will auto-fetch a title for markdown link ! If you paste an image, it\u0026rsquo;ll automatically prompt you for an image title after a timestamp. That way, if you use clear unused image, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see if you deleted unwanted images or not. The first header will automatically mimic the note title. And if you lint the file, the title metadata will change according to the title as well. There\u0026rsquo;s also improvements in the way footnotes are managed along with a configurable shortcut to create footnotes automatically numbered. I recommend setting ctrl + shift + ^. How Do I Use the Tasks and Projects ? I\u0026rsquo;ll explain here how to use it. But if you want to understand why I built it this way, I encourage you to read my explanations here.\nBasically you can create tasks everywhere except inside the following files and folders :\n1 2 3 4 5 path does not include Archives path does not include Templates path does not include Workout_Log path does not include Media Backlog path does not include _Sources There\u0026rsquo;s a predefined space inside your daily note to add some one-off tasks, it is below the Notes 📝 header. But you can use tasks alongside your notes anywhere else as long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t in one of the previously mentioned files or folder.\nThe workflow also involves using projects to achieve goals \u0026amp; objectives. Each goal or objective then must have a project with an according happens date for viewing purposes.\nBut where do I create such projects to achieves my goals \u0026amp; objectives? Inside an Area file (eg: Finances) under your 2-Areas folder. Areas are to be understood as areas of focus (GTD) or areas or responsibility (P.A.R.A), meaning areas of your life.\nEach Areas file template has a Projects 🎯 header. Markdown tasks inside the file are considered as Project, you can give it any task property you find useful but a deadline is important to use the setup properly. The task description can then be enclosed by [[ in order to create a wikilink to a project note inside the 1-Projects folder. You\u0026rsquo;ll find more informations about wikilinks in the obsidian documentation.\nIf you feel the need to use a recurring task like \u0026ldquo;Add recent transactions to my budget each week\u0026rdquo; inside your Finances area to maintain a standard, you might create a project called \u0026ldquo;Maintain a good budget\u0026rdquo;. Inside the project note, you can create a recurring task and that\u0026rsquo;s it. I would always recommend setting a happens date as it will help you see if it became a habit by then.\nBut how to display my current tasks ? That\u0026rsquo;s the job of the daily note. It will display tasks according to their happens date, and it will also display the tasks that has one of the three specific tags (that can\u0026rsquo;t be used at the same time by essence) : #next, #waiting and #delegated. They are displayed differently and tasks using the #next tag will be grouped by context, meaning by their other tag(s).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also the TaskBoard ✅ note where you\u0026rsquo;ll find unplanned tasks (without happens date or tags) so that you can\u0026rsquo;t miss a thing ! You should open this note sometimes to make sure nothing is left unattended.\nIn order to show which project you should be working on, you should rely on your periodic notes (weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly) to display the relative projects based on their first happen date. The Dashboard 🗺️ plays a similar role. There\u0026rsquo;s also a callout inside the daily note that queries upcoming projects (with a happens date in the next 30 days) and the projects in progress (using - [/] tasks status).\nThe Someday Maybe 💭 file is where you put your future goals and objectives in the form of a simple bullet list. Nothing fancy, we don\u0026rsquo;t care it\u0026rsquo;s not important as of now. But you might want to put things you want to do here, wait for a bit and decide if they\u0026rsquo;re still relevant after a while. If yes, simply create a project and start working on it !\nThe higher horizons of existence are covered in the Vision, Identity, Purpose \u0026amp; Principles ⚙️ note.\nBasically :\nVisions : Where and how you see yourself in 3-5 years. Identity : Who you are. Purpose : Your ultimate goal in life, why you\u0026rsquo;re in this world. Principles : Values you act upon everyday. How Do I Use the Journal ? You can write your feelings inside your daily note and each periodic notes, that\u0026rsquo;s always the last header purpose.\nThe daily note adds a grateful part in which you should describe the good things that happened each day, and the things you did that were good to the world.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a mood tracking property (mood:1-5) that ranges from 1=bad to 5=amazing. It could be used with the obsidian-tracker plugin to create a mood chart, but I have no use for it yet myself.\nI created a Journal 📓 note with a script that queries every single journal entries from your daily notes. Basically, it finds any header containing the word \u0026ldquo;Journal\u0026rdquo;, take the content, and stop at the next header found or the end of the note. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for the last time you had \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo;, just ctrl+f inside this note in read view and you\u0026rsquo;ll find it.\nIf you need to import your journal from Daylio like me, you might want to take a look at obsidian-daylio-parser repository on Github, or my fork of it that works well with my example vault.\nHow Do I Use the Workout Log ? If you right click on the -Workout-Log folder and select Create new note from template, you can select your workout template. It will be correctly named with a YYYY-MM-DD_ timestamp and will then be found inside the Workout Log 💪 callout of your daily note. Nothing fancy, just enough for keeping count.\nIt is important that the first header of your workout template keep the templater code snippet. This is how the timestamp is added to the template file name.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find that I added goals to sections of my workout linked to goals in my Sport area. You can do something like this, or not. Experiment with queries and filters from the dataview plugin or the task plugin, you can make very powerful things without much effort. You just need to read their doc !\nTake extra care where moving file from the 5-Templates folder to the archives or anywhere else. You should remove the templater code from everywhere before doing so, otherwise it might end up in an infinite loop of template file creation because of filename-heading-sync and templater plugin working asynchronously.\nHow Do I Use the Media Backlog ? Your Media Backlog 🎮 file is a simple Kanban board. It is self explicit, just keep in mind that the daily note\u0026rsquo;s Ongoing Medias 🎮 callout will query some kanban cards. But only the one inside columns that contains Doing. That\u0026rsquo;ll help you to know what you could be doing during your daily spare time today.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some predefined tags with emojis that you can find in the colorful-tag plugin settings.\nIf you finished something, you can add a date on the kanban board by using the Add a date command from right clicking the card.\nYou might want to add the #ongoing tag if there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a sequel and you want to get back to it later on.\nHow Do I Use the The Read-it-later and Bookmark Manager ? This part is pretty simple. You simply need to connect your Omnivore account, add some pages to your inbox. It will then be synced to Obsidian inside the _Sources folder each time you use the Omnivore button on Obsidian left side bar. It has been configured to import inside a different daily folder based on when you saved the link. The generated markdown file will contains the document notes from Omnivore, then your highlight and content notes, and finally the whole converted markdown page. Simple as that !\nIt allows you to simply search inside Obsidian if you want to find past knowledge you came across. That\u0026rsquo;s why I love it.\nI wont describe too much functionalities here as the app and plugin are in active development. I\u0026rsquo;ll let you discover the magic with their documentation.\nHow Do I Use The Note Sharing Process ? The whole process is detailed in another post.\nThe note sharing process requires to create a Hugo website first on Github Pages. Once it\u0026rsquo;s done, you can simply change the share boolean to true in the note frontmatter, then select the command Upload filename to DEFAULT of the obsidian-github-publisher plugin from the note drop down menu. It will use some regex to convert wikilinks to standard Hugo links formatting, commit and push to the relevant repository on Github, make a pull request that\u0026rsquo;ll be automatically accepted (allowing for easy reversing changes), and then use some Github Actions to build your website.\nAttachments are automatically sent as well as linked notes as long as they have the share boolean set to true as well.\nThe posts will be sent to the content/post folder and the attachments to the content/images folder.\nDetailed Explanations Links Why Using Obsidian for Life Management Obsidian Publish Alternative, How to One-click Upload Your Notes on Your Own Website How is the Vault Organised ? This setup relies heavily on Obsidian wikilinks and tags for task and project management, but also for attachment cleaning. One should take the habit to use them.\n_Media folder : Storing all attachments (images and pdf for example) in the same folder using the YYYY-MM-DD_filename.extension pattern thanks to obsidian-paste-image-rename. Beware, all the attachments must be linked inside a note, otherwise the use of plugins such as Find orphaned files and broken links and Clean unused images might delete them. _Sources folder : Storing all the websites sources you saved automatically using Omnivore or manually using markdownload. -Daily-Notes folder : Storing daily notes for tasks management, quick-notes and journaling. -Periodic-Notes folder : Storing weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes for project management and journaling. -Workout_Log folder : Storing your workout logs. 0-Inbox folder : Newly created files automatically goes here. However, using the file explorer on the left you can create note wherever you want. 1-Projects folder : Project files containing markdown notes, tasks, embedded attachments (attachments are still stored inside the _Media folder, but you can embed them inside projet notes), wikilinks to useful notes or whatever you need to complete your projects. That\u0026rsquo;s the real power of Obsidian, you can organise projects naturally, just like you would do using a piece of paper. 2-Areas folder : Containing main areas of responsibility of your life files. That\u0026rsquo;s in these files that you\u0026rsquo;ll create projects in the form of tasks with a wikilink to a project note. 3-Resources folder : Contains all of your notes and stuff ! 4-Archives folder : Contains done or cancelled projects, no longer relevant and old resources that you might never need again… But you might also need once again, so you archive it instead of deleting it. 5-Templates folder : Contains all your file templates used by the templater plugin. Vision, Purpose and Principles ⚙️ file : Contains your visions (3-5 year goals), who you are, what is your purpose in life and what are your principles. Taskboard ✅ file : Useful to scan for unplanned tasks across your vault. Someday Maybe 💭 file : Write someday maybe projects, things to do one day and goals you\u0026rsquo;d like to achieve. Media Backlog 🎮 file : Kanban board of your upcoming, current and past media consumption. Journal 📓 file : Contains all the Journal entries of your daily notes. Dashboard 🗺️ file : Contains your active projects by dates, areas and your currently unplanned projects.

I\u0026rsquo;m just stating the pros and cons of each of the three options on the title, because they basically have almost the same tools.\nWave+ Pros Rounder finish, helps to get a better hold and apply more force to the pliers. Charge+ Pros Over the Wave+ Better knife blade (154CM steel instead of 420HC one) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk for more information). Gut hook on the serrated blade, useful to cut strings in a safer way and for butchering an animal. Classy finish with handgrips. Might be harder to put pressure on it, but better grip and finish. Pocket clip is sold with the Charge+. The molle sheath has two pockets for lights and or pens, the wave doesn\u0026rsquo;t have additional pockets. Partial bit kit is added with the most useful bits (https://www.knivesandtools.fr/fr/pt/-leatherman-charge-plus-pince-multifonction-etui-en-nylon.htm). Cons Over the Wave+ The crimper might be harder to use because the protections around the tool are heavier and bulkier, hence you\u0026rsquo;ll triple crimp sometimes. Bulkier. Like he really feels bigger. Charge+ TTI Pros Over the Charge+ Lighter (really small difference). Premium finish. Better knife blade (S30V steel instead of 154CM one) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk for more information). Small upgrade over the 154CM one, while the 420HC is last by far (3 to 4 times worse edge retention). Cons Over the Charge+ The plier might break easily because of the additional crimper on it. At least many people said that. Conclusion Basically, each one is an upgrade from the other one. But these upgrades are not useful for everyone and should be considered as the price increase is quite huge.\nI ended up buying a Wave+ because I don\u0026rsquo;t need the hook, I needed the full bit kit anyway, I have a tactical pouch where I\u0026rsquo;ll put it so I don\u0026rsquo;t need the sheath, and if the blade isn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the others to cut through ropes and card boxes, I\u0026rsquo;ll use the serrated blade anyway so it is not a problem.\nIn addition, I recommend buying a Work Sharp Guided Field Sharpener for sharpening your leatherman : https://www.worksharptools.com/shop/benchtop/manual/guided-field-sharpener/\nHave a nice day, hope it helps !\n","date":"2023-02-22T14:25:33Z","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/leatherman-wave-charge-and-charge-tti-comparison/","title":"Leatherman Wave+, Charge+ and Charge+ TTI Comparison"},{"content":"How to Use Obsidian Git Sync on Android Inspirations My old guide using cron jobs with time intervals instead of tasker How to sync your obsidian vault on mobile using git Mobile Sync for Obsidian | Some Thoughts Automatically sync notes to and from git repository whenever you open and close Obsidian on mobile. · GitHub Obsidian Syncing Alternative (For Android and iOS) | Obsidian-Sync-Alternative Install the Required Tools Install Tasker from the official website (7 days trial) or from the Google Play Store (~3.5€).\nInstall Termux, Termux Widget, Termux Tasker on F-droid or on the official Termux Github repository.\n[!attention] Never use the play store version Trust me it is depreciated.\nGive Termux access to your storage using the following command :\n1 termux-setup-storage Setup Git and Github for Manipulating Repositories Use the following commands to setup git and github via HTTPS :\n1 pkg update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pkg upgrade 1 pkg install git 1 pkg install gh You can use SSH or an access token as well instead of using gh\nLogin to your Github account :\n1 gh auth login Update the git configs :\n1 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; 1 git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email\u0026#34; Go into the shared folder :\n1 cd ~/storage/shared/ Clone your repo :\n1 git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GH_USERNAME/Lifewiki.git Try using the following commands :\n1 2 3 4 git status git pull git commit git push [!Attention] Android 12 warning If you are on Android 12, you\u0026rsquo;ll get an error with the command required to add the repository to a security list or something like that.

How is it independant ? We\u0026rsquo;ll make sure that GRUB (Linux Bootloader) will install itself on the Linux Drive, and won\u0026rsquo;t be on your Windows drive with Windows Bootloader. That means you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to remove any of the two drives and use them on any other machine you want.\nThe setup will work as follow :\nReferences Dual Booting Ubuntu With Windows 10 Pro With BitLocker Encryption - It\u0026rsquo;s FOSS Dual boot Windows + Linux with encryption - Super User How to encrypt a dual boot setup with two drives (SSD) - General Linux Question - It\u0026rsquo;s FOSS Community How to encrypt a dual boot setup with two drives (SSD) - Linux Mint Forums [SOLVED] Dual booting Mint on a second drive independently. - Linux Mint Forums Special thanks to AndyMH who helped me on Reddit, and kept helping me by mail and on the Linux Mint Forums. Before Doing Anything Requirement In order to follow this guide you need :\nTwo drives (SSD1 or HDD,2 it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter at all). Verify that the second drive you just installed is recognized by Windows by opening the Windows File Explorer. From now on during this guide, your C drive will be the one referenced as your Windows Drive. And your D drive as the one that will get Linux Mint.\nWindows 11 Pro Edition : Cheap keys can be bought at Cdiscount for ~1€. That also means you need a motherboard that supports TPM 2.0 in order to have Windows 11 (At least that\u0026rsquo;s what I read on the internet). Alternative path : Using VeraCrypt instead of Bitlocker as an encrypting software for the Windows side of the dual boot. I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about it, but you might pioneer something.\nA USB Key of at least 16 gb (I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly, it just worked for me with that size). A computer that might be compatible with Linux thanks to your hardware. If you want to verify, you can check with : Linux Mint - Community : Linux Mint known compatible devices. Certified hardware | Ubuntu : Ubuntu certified devices. Ubuntu-MSI-laptops : This is an example, but there is a page for many laptop brands for instance. An internet connection might help (a lot). Backup. First, backup your computer. If you follow this guide, it could work. But it might as well fail, and you\u0026rsquo;ll thank your past-self if you have a backup.\nI am personnaly using Macrium Software | Reflect Free Edition and an eHDD (external hard drive) to create a full image backup in case things get messy. Whatever you choose to do, do a backup.\nEnable and Disable Bitlocker Encryption to Make Sure it Works Well Before doing anything, we want to make sure that Bitlocker is working properly.\nSearch on Windows for \u0026ldquo;Manage Bitlocker\u0026rdquo;. Encrypt your C Drive. Use the \u0026ldquo;Encrypt entire drive\u0026rdquo; option along with the \u0026ldquo;New encryption mode\u0026rdquo; that will use your TPM. Backup your recovery key. Print it, put it in the cloud, do whatever you want, but keep it. Be careful. Every time you\u0026rsquo;ll exit the encryption wizard, the backup key is changing. So remember to back it up again if you cancelled it to prepare yourself some spaghetti.\nLet the encryption process do its thing. Reboot and make sure it works. Now that hopefully everything works well, go back to \u0026ldquo;Manage Bitlocker\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Turn off Bitlocker\u0026rdquo;. Yes, you heard me. Do you want a safe dual boot process ? We just verified that everything works well. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Make sure to turn if off completely. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to just suspend encryption, you want to turn it off.\nEdit : As we will remove the Windows Drive (physically or by using some manipulation with Gparted), it should also work if you keep it Bitlocker encrypted. Or if it isn\u0026rsquo;t yet encrypted. They should be completely independent anyway. But I\u0026rsquo;m a crazily paranoid man, that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m putting it here.\nSetup Preparation Preparing Your Windows Setup for the Dual Boot Experience Windows has many things that could make your dual-boot setup goes wrong. That\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;ll make sure everything goes as smooth as possible by doing the following things :\nRemove fast-boot by going into the old alimentation settings of windows, choose actions when button pressed and remove fast boot, hibernate and (optional) sleep mode. Then, open a cmd as admin and type powercfg -h off. Search for hiberfil.sys for additional information on how to deactivate fast-boot. Remove fast boot from the Bios as well. Remove secure-boot from your Bios. Remove Intel Fast Start from Bios. I won\u0026rsquo;t be explaining much moredependentis dependent on your system. Google will be your best friend, but don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to ask for help somewhere.\nPreparing Your Linux Mint Installation Medium Follow the instructions on the Linux Mint wiki and download the .iso (Choose the right edition—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). Verify your ISO (integrity and authenticity : Verify your ISO image—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). Create the bootable media with Etcher (Create the bootable media—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). That\u0026rsquo;s it. You\u0026rsquo;re ready. Things are going to become interesting now.\nBeginning the Dual-boot Process Shut down your laptop. Connect your USB key to the laptop and boot. It should go on Linux live by default, if not, change your boot order in your Bios. Windows Hard-drive Disconnection In order to create a completely independent dual-boot setup, we want to disconnect the Windows Drive before doing the Linux Mint installation. If you can physically disconnect the drive, go on, do it, and skip the following Gparted part. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a laptop and/or don\u0026rsquo;t want to bother, read the following.\nRun Gparted by searching for it in the admin section of the applications. Find your Windows disk with 4 partitions (EFI, MS reserved, C:, and a recovery partition). The drive may appear as nvme0n1 and the first partition as nvme0n1p1 if this is an nVME SSD. Otherwise, in linux, the first drive in the system is sda, the next sdb and so on. The first partition on a drive would be sda1, the next sda2 and so on.\nSelect the EFI partition (fat32, size less than 500mb, and flags BOOT and ESP set). Select “manage flags”. Uncheck the BOOT and ESP flags. The partition will now appear with the msftdata flag. Close Gparted. Installing Linux Mint Launch install Mint. Follow the instructions (Install Linux Mint—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). But be careful, you will need to click on \u0026ldquo;Continue testing\u0026rdquo; at the end of the installation process if you chose to disconnect the Windows Drive virtually using Gparted and flags. Select \u0026ldquo;Erase disk and install Linux Mint\u0026rdquo;. Make sure there is no OS detected on the actual drive and that it is your second drive, and it will do his partitioning thing on the newly added drive. I think you can choose to use LVM and LUKS full disk encryption here. Do it. But be careful, maybe you keyboard setup is not the one you physically have. Type your password on the search bar to be sure! Choose a short computer and username. For instance, I\u0026rsquo;m using \u0026ldquo;MSI-GL75\u0026rdquo; as a computer name and my first name as my username. You\u0026rsquo;ll thank me later. Select \u0026ldquo;Require my password to log in\u0026rdquo; and tick \u0026ldquo;Encrypt my home folder\u0026rdquo;. Select \u0026ldquo;Continue testing\u0026rdquo; at the end of the installation process. Run Gparted and enable back the ESP and BOOT flags on the EFI Windows partition. Reboot and go into bios settings. Put Ubuntu at the top of the list of the boot order. You should now boot immediatelyinto Linux Mint instead Grub dual-boot menu. It is normal. Open up a terminal with ctrl+alt+ and type sudo update-grub. Grub config will be updated by finding the Windows EFI partition. Grub will now be working Now you should have a working dual-boot setup with Linux Mint encrypted. But wait a bit, we still need to encrypt Windows and change a few things.\nOh, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to think about a backup for Linux Mint. You now have Macrium Reflect for Windows. There\u0026rsquo;s Timeshift and Backintime that can help backing up your system files and personall files respectively.\nAfter Installing Linux Mint : A Few Things to Change A Beautiful Grub Menu You want a beautiful Grub boot menu like that and not just a command line type of dual-boot screen ?

But when you boot into Windows, it shows the wrong time. Sometimes, it is the opposite and Linux shows the wrong time and Windows has the correct time.\nThat’s strange specially because you are connected to the internet and your date and time is set to be used automatically.\nDon’t worry! You are not the only one to face this issue. You can fix it by using the following command in the Linux terminal:\n1 timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 If you want some explanations, follow this link to get the full guide :\n[Solved] Wrong Time in Windows 10 After Dual Boot With Linux\nPrepare Group Policies for Windows Encryption Allow Complexe Password and Not Just Pin Open the Group Policy Editor (type gpedit after opening the start menu) and navigate to Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; Bitlocker Drive Encryption \u0026gt; Operating System Drives Enable \u0026ldquo;Allow enhanced PINS for startup\u0026rdquo; : Allows you to use a real password and not just numbers for your encryption. Add a Password at Startup You can follow Chris Hoffman\u0026rsquo;s guide entirely, as this is the one I used here :\nHow to Enable a Pre-Boot BitLocker PIN on Windows\nStep One: Enable BitLocker (If You Haven’t Already) This is a BitLocker feature, so you have to use BitLocker encryption to set a pre-boot PIN. This is only available on Professional and Enterprise editions of Windows. Before you can set a PIN, you have to enable BitLocker for your system drive.\nNote that, if you go out of your way to enable BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, you’ll be prompted to create a startup password that’s used instead of the TPM. The below steps are only necessary when enabling BitLocker on computers with TPMs, which most modern computers have.\nIf you have a Home version of Windows, you won’t be able to use BitLocker. You may have the Device Encryption feature instead, but this works differently from BitLocker and doesn’t allow you to provide a startup key.\nStep Two: Enable the Startup PIN in Group Policy Editor Once you’ve enabled BitLocker, you’ll need to go out of your way to enable a PIN with it. This requires a Group Policy settings change. To open the Group Policy Editor, press Windows+R, type “gpedit.msc” into the Run dialog, and press Enter.\nHead to Computer Configuration \u0026gt; Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; BitLocker Drive Encryption \u0026gt; Operating System Drives in the Group Policy window.\nDouble-click the “Require Additional Authentication at Startup” Option in the right pane.\nSelect “Enabled” at the top of the window here. Then, click the box under “Configure TPM Startup PIN” and select the “Require Startup PIN With TPM” option. Click “OK” to save your changes.\nStep Three: Add a PIN to Your Drive You can now use the manage-bde command to add the PIN to your BitLocker-encrypted drive.\nTo do this, launch a Command Prompt window as Administrator. On Windows 10 or 8, right-click the Start button and select “Command Prompt (Admin)”. On Windows 7, find the “Command Prompt” shortcut in the Start menu, right-click it, and select “Run as Administrator”\nRun the following command. The below command works on your C: drive, so if you want to require a startup key for another drive, enter its drive letter instead of c: .\n1 manage-bde -protectors -add c: -TPMAndPIN You’ll be prompted to enter your PIN here. The next time you boot, you’ll be asked for this PIN.\nTip: If you see an error, run the gpupdate command on its own line before running the manage-bde command shown above. This will force Windows to apply your group policy changes.\nTo double-check whether the TPMAndPIN protector was added, you can run the following command:\n1 manage-bde -status (The “Numerical Password” key protector displayed here is your recovery key.)\nHow to Change Your BitLocker PIN To change the PIN in the future, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator and run the following command:\n1 manage-bde -changepin c: You’ll need to type and confirm your new PIN before continuing.\nHow to Remove the PIN Requirement If you change your mind and want to stop using the PIN later, you can undo this change.\nFirst, you’ll need to head to the Group Policy window and change the option back to “Allow Startup PIN With TPM”. You can’t leave the option set to “Require Startup PIN With TPM” or Windows won’t allow you to remove the PIN.\nNext, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator and run the following command:\n1 manage-bde -protectors -add c: -TPM This will replace the “TPMandPIN” requirement with a “TPM” requirement, deleting the PIN. Your BitLocker drive will automatically unlock via your computer’s TPM when you boot.\nTo check that this completed successfully, run the status command again:\n1 manage-bde -status c: If you forget the PIN, you’ll need to provide the BitLocker recovery code you should have saved somewhere safe when you enabled BitLocker for your system drive.\nPrevent Bitlocker From Asking for Your Recovery Code Everytime You Boot Link to the answer by ouk :\nwindows 10 - BitLocker asking for protection code after Ubuntu installation - Super User\nOpen the Group Policy Editor (type gpedit after opening the start menu) and navigate to Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; Bitlocker Drive Encryption \u0026gt; Operating System Drives Enable \u0026ldquo;Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations\u0026rdquo; : The standard configuration includes PCR 0, 2, 4, 7 and 11. You should only keep 0, 2 and 11. PCR 7 is disabled when Secure Boot is. PCR 4 should be disabled to allow Grub to work properly with the GRUB_DEFAULT=saved feature enabled. Activate Bitlocker Just turn on Bitlocker like before on your Windows drive, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to save the recovery key because it will change, and that\u0026rsquo;s it, you\u0026rsquo;ve done it.\nYou can now be a proud encrypted dual-boot user.

Now I don\u0026rsquo;t have a good image quality since the few last updates, but I know it\u0026rsquo;s related to my phone and the support is going to help about that.\nSame quality as far as I tested it out (used it for the last 2 years) but it is slower in scanning, resizing and especially in changing filter. It might be related to my phone, but if my phone can be that fast in Notebloc, it means it should be the same for everyone as my phone is not a standard in speed.\nFinally we have GeniusScan. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to admit, I like the fact that this is a French company developping it. But I took it for his precise autocrop and his quality.
