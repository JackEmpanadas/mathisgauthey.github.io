&lt;p>Hi everyone, as I compared these bad boys before buying my first leatherman, I might as well share it! I&amp;rsquo;m just stating the pros and cons of each of the three options on the title, because they basically have almost the same tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wave">Wave+&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="pros">Pros&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rounder finish, helps to get a better hold and apply more force to the pliers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="charge">Charge+&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="pros-over-the-wave">Pros Over the Wave+&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Better knife blade (154CM steel instead of 420HC one) (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk&lt;/a> for more information).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gut hook on the serrated blade, useful to cut strings in a safer way and for butchering an animal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Classy finish with handgrips. Might be harder to put pressure on it, but better grip and finish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pocket clip is sold with the Charge+.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The molle sheath has two pockets for lights and or pens, the wave doesn&amp;rsquo;t have additional pockets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Partial bit kit is added with the most useful bits (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.knivesandtools.fr/fr/pt/-leatherman-charge-plus-pince-multifonction-etui-en-nylon.htm%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.knivesandtools.fr/fr/pt/-leatherman-charge-plus-pince-multifonction-etui-en-nylon.htm)&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="cons-over-the-wave">Cons Over the Wave+&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The crimper might be harder to use because the protections around the tool are heavier and bulkier, hence you&amp;rsquo;ll triple crimp sometimes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bulkier. Like he really feels bigger.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="charge-tti">Charge+ TTI&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="pros-over-the-charge">Pros Over the Charge+&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lighter (really small difference).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Premium finish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better knife blade (S30V steel instead of 154CM one) (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk&lt;/a> for more information). Small upgrade over the 154CM one, while the 420HC is last by far (3 to 4 times worse edge retention).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="cons-over-the-charge">Cons Over the Charge+&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The plier might break easily because of the additional crimper on it. At least many people said that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Basically, each one is an upgrade from the other one. But these upgrades are not useful for everyone and should be considered as the price increase is quite huge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended up buying a Wave+ because I don&amp;rsquo;t need the hook, I needed the full bit kit anyway, I have a tactical pouch where I&amp;rsquo;ll put it so I don&amp;rsquo;t need the sheath, and if the blade isn&amp;rsquo;t as good as the others to cut through ropes and card boxes, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the serrated blade anyway so it is not a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, I recommend buying a Work Sharp Guided Field Sharpener for sharpening your leatherman : &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.worksharptools.com/shop/benchtop/manual/guided-field-sharpener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Have a nice day, hope it helps !&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Best Android Scanner App for 2021 in My Opinion</title><link>https://mathisgauthey.github.io/the-best-android-scanner-app-for-2021-in-my-opinion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 07:41:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mathisgauthey.github.io/the-best-android-scanner-app-for-2021-in-my-opinion/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-best-android-scanner-app-for-2021-in-my-opinion">The Best Android Scanner App for 2021 in My Opinion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Hi everyone, good morning from France o/&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent 2 hours yesterday testing android apps from these two links :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/elxi9x/reviews_best_document_scanner_apps_for_android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/elxi9x/reviews_best_document_scanner_apps_for_android/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/d06zmg/after_camscanner_malware_mess_i_went_on_a_quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/d06zmg/after_camscanner_malware_mess_i_went_on_a_quest/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>They are a bit outdated (1 year ago) so I decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t go far in my explanation but what I was looking for was :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Free or small one time purchase (NO SUBSCRIPTION)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Google Drive Sync&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Very good color and B/W quality for printing handwritten notes as a student&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Batch scan with the ability (like Camscanner) to resize images fast and to change the filter easily&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fast to boot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good autocrop feature&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I decided not to care about OCR but the tools I chose are quite good from what I heard in Reddit and the comment section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is my TOP 3 with my phone (Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite with a pretty bad camera)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Notebloc (or ClearScan which is basically the same app, take the one with the lowest price)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SwiftScan (former Scanbot)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GeniusScan&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Why ? Notebloc is basically Camscanner for free with amazing image quality and Google Drive Sync. 3.59â‚¬ wasn&amp;rsquo;t much, I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything else to say, it is amazing and most importantly : Fast to scan, resize and change the filter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Swiftscan offered good image quality while being quite slow before. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good image quality since the few last updates, but I know it&amp;rsquo;s related to my phone and the support is going to help about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Same quality as far as I tested it out (used it for the last 2 years) but it is slower in scanning, resizing and especially in changing filter. It might be related to my phone, but if my phone can be that fast in Notebloc, it means it should be the same for everyone as my phone is not a standard in speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally we have GeniusScan. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to admit, I like the fact that this is a French company developping it. But I took it for his precise autocrop and his quality. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as good as the other two even if he was fast, but in the end we do want great filter quality and pdf quality, so I decided not to put him before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it, if you want to make your own opinion about that, you can check the two links I dropped at the beginning of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TL : DR :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notebloc : Good quality and amazingly fast&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SwiftScan : Good quality but now has problems with my phones and some other, slower because of optimization andbecause of the way features are implemented&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GeniusScan : Amazingly fast with good autocrop but can&amp;rsquo;t compete with scan quality of the other two&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have a wonderful day, stay safe everyone o/&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
